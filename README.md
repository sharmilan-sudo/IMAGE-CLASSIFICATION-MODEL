Task Description: CNN-Based Image Classification

The objective of this task is to design, implement, and evaluate a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for image classification using a deep learning framework such as TensorFlow or PyTorch. Image classification is a core problem in computer vision where the goal is to automatically identify and categorize images into predefined classes based on their visual content.

In this task, a labeled image dataset is used as input. The initial step involves data preprocessing, which includes loading the dataset, resizing images to a fixed resolution, and normalizing pixel values to improve training efficiency. The dataset is then split into training and testing sets to assess the model’s ability to generalize to unseen images.

A CNN model is constructed using multiple layers such as convolutional layers for feature extraction, pooling layers for dimensionality reduction, and fully connected layers for classification. Activation functions like ReLU are applied to introduce non-linearity, while a softmax function is used in the output layer to generate class probabilities.

The model is compiled with an appropriate loss function and optimizer, and trained using the training dataset over several epochs. During training, the model learns hierarchical features from the images, ranging from simple edges to complex patterns.

After training, the CNN is evaluated on the test dataset to measure its performance. Evaluation metrics such as accuracy and loss are used to determine how effectively the model classifies unseen images. This task demonstrates the complete workflow of building an image classification system using CNNs and fulfills the internship requirement of delivering a functional deep learning model with performance evaluation.
